APOD
====
One of the open APIs provided by NASA. A good example of what this API can do is the `Astronomy Picture of the Day website <https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html>`_, wich gives you a new image/photograph of the universe every day. 
Also, each image has a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer, acording to the website.
I know, this is amazing.
